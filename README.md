A **To-Do List** is a simple and effective tool designed to help individuals organize and manage their tasks or activities efficiently. It typically consists of a list of items or goals that need to be accomplished within a specified period. Users can write down tasks in order of priority or by categories such as work, personal, or study-related.

Modern to-do lists often include features like:  
- **Task Categorization:** Group tasks by themes or projects.  
- **Deadlines:** Assign due dates to stay on schedule.  
- **Progress Tracking:** Mark completed tasks or check them off.  
- **Reminders and Notifications:** Get alerts for upcoming deadlines.  
- **Collaboration:** Share lists with others for group projects.  

To-do lists can be as simple as pen and paper or as advanced as digital apps with cross-device synchronization, enhancing productivity and time management.
